# Mathematical Operation

- Mathematical Operations can only be done with intergers and

## Addition

-  **Addition** can be done using the **"+"** with any **floats** or **integers**.
- Mathematical operations follow the **BIDMAS** (**B**rackets, **I**ndices, **D**ivision, **M**ultiplication, **A**ddition, **S**ubstraction) rule.
- As previously mentioned, **"+"** can be used to concatenate strings.

## Subtraction
- Similarly to addition, **subtraction** can be done using the **“-”** with any **integers** or **floats**.
- **Subtractions** and **additions** following the **BIDMAS** rule have equal importance.
- The order of mathematical operation with equal importance is determined by which one is closer to the left.
## Multiplication
- **Multiplication** is python is done by using the **"*"**  symbol
## Division
