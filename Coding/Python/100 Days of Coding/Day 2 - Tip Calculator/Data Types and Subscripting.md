# Data Types
- **Strings**
- **Floats**
- **Interger**
- **Boolean**

## Strings
- A string is a series of characters, this can include numbers, puntion or letters
- When expressing a string **""** are normally used
- Any number typed in between **""** will be treated as a string.

## Interger
- An Interger is a whole number, meaning it has no decimal points
- Intergers are created when the value is inserted without any **""**
- Since intergers are treated as numbers, they can be used in calculations
- Intergers can be typed with **__** in between them, the computer interprets it exactly the same way as if they weren't there. It's the same way **","** are inserted between every third number when dealing with large numbers in real life. Example: `number = 123_456_789` has the same value as `number = 123456789`
- Intergers can be positive or negative

## Float
- **Floats** are another data type. 
- **Float** is refering to the floating decimal point. It is ddescribed this way be cause the decimal can be in between any two numbers

## Boolean
- **Booleans** are a simple data type.
- They only have 2 values: **True** or **False**
- They have to be type with the first letter being capitalized
- **Booleans** are used a lot in loops

# Subscripting
- **Subscripting** is a method used to pull out a perticular eliment of a string
- It is normally done by using **"[]"** with tthe  number in between the square brackets representing the position of the character  in sequential order.
- When selecting the number to put in between teh square brackets, make sure to remember that the **1st** number is represent by **0**.
- An example of **Subscripting** could be done like this. 
- `print("Hello"[0])`
- This would print: **H**
