## Description
- The network layer takes the segment from layer 4 and adds a header to it to create a "**packet**". The Network is responsible for delivering the packet to the destination computer. If there is more than one route to the destination computer, the network layer chooses the best path for the packet to take. The network layer treats each packet independently, so it is possible that two packets from the same transmission might take different paths to arrive at the destination computer.
