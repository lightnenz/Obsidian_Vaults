## Description
- The Data link layer takes packets from the network layer, and adds another header to form a "**frame**". The Data link layer can also add a trailer to the frame, such as a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). A CRC is a simple mathematical calculation performed on each frame to ensure it hasn't been corrupted in transit.
- Finally, the Data link layer translates the frames into bits for the Physical Layer.
