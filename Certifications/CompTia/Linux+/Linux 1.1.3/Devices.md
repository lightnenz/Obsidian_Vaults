# Devices
- There are two main types of devices. **Block** devices and **Character** devices.
- These are very similar and are primaly used to get data in and out of a Linux system.
- **Block** devices use buffers and caches to make the transfer of large amounts of data smoother.
- Most file storage devices are **Block** devices. This can include things such as external hard drives, memory sticks or larger eternal file systems.
- **Character** devices transfer one character at a time as a continuous string. There is no buffering involved in this process.
- **Character** devices can be connected to some cables, such as serial ports. These are used for monitoring purposes.
