## The problem with Manual configuration
Manually configuring cloud infrastructure allows you to easily start using new services to quickly prototype architectures, however it comes with many downsides.
- It's easy to mis-configure a service through human error
- It's hard to manage the expected state o the configuration for compliance
- It's hard to transfer configuration knowledge to other team members
- It can be more difficult to replicate

## Infrastructure as code (**IaC**)
You write a configuration script to **automate** creating, updating or destroying cloud infrastructure>
- IaC is a **blueprint** of your infrastructure
- IaC allows you to **easily share, version or inventory** your cloud infrastructure
