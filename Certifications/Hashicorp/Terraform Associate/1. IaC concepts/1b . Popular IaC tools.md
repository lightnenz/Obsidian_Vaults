## Declarative
- What you see is what you get. *Explicit
- More verbose, but zero chance of mis-configuration
- Uses scripting languages eg. JSON, YAML, XML
- **Azure** uses **ARM(Azure Resource Manager) templates** and **Azure Blueprints**
- **AWS** uses **CloudFormation
- **GCP** uses **Cloud Deployment Manager**
- **Terraform** is also declarative and supports many cloud and on-premise providerss.
- Declarative IaC tends to be better for System administrators or people not used to standard programming languages.
- This is better if you prefer to know everything that is happening and dont want anything left to change.

## Imperative
- You tell it what you want, and the rest is filled in. *Implicit*
- Less verbose, you could end up with mis-configuration
- **Imperative** can do more than **Declarative**
- Uses standard programming languages eg, **Python, Ruby, JavaScript**
- **AWS** has **AWS Cloud Development Kit**
- **Pulumi** is also Imperative and supports **AWS, Azure, GCP and K8s**
- Imperative IaC is normally better for users who have a programming background.
- Imperative IaC is better if you just want to quickly get things going and don't necessarily need to understand what's happening under the hood.
