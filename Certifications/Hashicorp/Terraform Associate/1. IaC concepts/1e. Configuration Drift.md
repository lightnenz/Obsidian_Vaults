**Configuration Drift** is when provisioned infrastructure has an unexpected configuration change due to:
- Team members manually adjusting configuration options
- malicious actors
- side affects from APIs, SDK or CLIs.

**Configuration Drift** going unnoticed could be loss or breach of cloud services and residing data, or result in interruption of services or unexpected downtime.

## How to detect Configuration Drift
- A compliance tool can detect misconfiguration. e.g. **AWS Config, Azure policies and GCP Analytics**
- Built-in support for drift detection e.g. **AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection**
- Storing the expected state e.g. **Terraform state files**

## How to correct the configuration drift?
- A compliance tool can remediate misconfiguration, e.g. AWS Config
- Terraform refresh and plan commands
- Manually correcting the configuration (not recommended)
- Tearing down and setting up the infrastructure again

## How to prevent configuration drift?
- **Immutable Infrastructure**, always create and destroy, never reuse, Blue, Green deployment strategy.
	- Servers are never modified after they are deployed
		- Baking AMI images or containers via AWS Image Builder or HashiCorp Packer, or a build server e.g. GCP Cloud Run.
- Using GitOps to version control our IaC, and peer review every single version via Pull requests change to infrastructure.
