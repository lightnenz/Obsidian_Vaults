# Infrastructure Lifecycle

## What is Infrastructure Lifecycle?
A number of clearly defined and distinct work phases which are used by DevOps Engineers to **plan, design, build, test, deliver, maintain and retire infrastructure.

#### What are Day 0, Day 1 and Day 2?
Day 0-2 is a simplified way to describe phases of Infrastructure lifecycle
- Day 0 - Plan and Design
- Day 1 - Develop and Iterate
- Day 2 - is when we go live and maintain it
**IaC** usually starts on **Day 0** with the planning stage

## IaC advantages

#### Reliability
- **IaC** makes changes idempotent, consistent, repeatable, and predictable.
- No matter how many times you run the same **IaC** you will always end up with the same state that is expected.

#### Manageability
- Enable mutation via code
- revised, with minimal changes

#### Sensibility
- Avoid financial and reputational losses when considering government and military uses.
